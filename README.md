## MNIST Benchmark (Python, C++, Rust)

This project contains simple benchmarks for training a model on the MNIST dataset using Python, C++, and Rust.

## Hardware Requirement

You need an **NVIDIA GPU** with **CUDA** installed to run these benchmarks. They are not configured to run on CPU or other hardware.

## Instructions

See the `README.md` file in each language's directory for specific instructions:
- [`python/README.md`](python/README.md)
- [`cpp/README.md`](cpp/README.md)
- [`rust/README.md`](rust/README.md)
